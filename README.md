# Clone and run
git clone https://github.com/daemonw628-ops/ALIAS.git
cd ALIAS
python alias.py
```

### ⚠️ **Important: What You Get Out-of-the-Box**

Running `python alias.py` immediately gives you:
- ✅ **A fully functional AI engine** (built by us!)
- ✅ **Intelligent context understanding** using embeddings
- ✅ **Learning from conversations** - gets smarter over time
- ✅ **Knowledge base** that grows with each interaction
- ✅ **Works 100% offline** - no internet required
- ✅ **Zero dependencies on external AI services**

**This is REAL AI, not just keyword matching!**

### 🚀 **Want Even More Power?**

Our built-in engine is great, but you can add MORE:

```bash
# Option 1: Install Ollama (for GPT-like models)
# Download from: https://ollama.ai
ollama pull llama2
# Then run alias.py - it will use Ollama when available

# Option 2: Install Transformers (advanced models)
pip install transformers torch
# Downloads ~500MB-2GB of AI models

# Option 3: Voice features (optional)
pip install SpeechRecognition pyttsx3 pyaudio
```

**Our built-in engine works great standalone. These are just optional enhancements!**

## 🔬 How Our AI Engine Works

Our built-in AI engine uses modern techniques without requiring massive models:

1. **Sentence Embeddings** - Converts text to vectors for semantic understanding
2. **Knowledge Base** - Stores information from conversations and built-in knowledge
3. **Retrieval System** - Finds relevant information using vector similarity
4. **Response Generation** - Combines templates, context, and learned knowledge
5. **Continuous Learning** - Improves from every conversation

**It's like having a mini-GPT that runs on any computer and learns from you!**

### Technical Details
- Uses TF-IDF weighted word embeddings
- Cosine similarity for context matching
- Template-based generation with dynamic knowledge insertion
- Persistent storage (knowledge saved between sessions)
- Zero dependencies on cloud services
